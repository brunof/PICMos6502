ISSUES:
- writeRAM time while writing isnt adjusted...
- in BCC instruction, branch operand is assumed to be UNSIGNED int8(always forward branch). Maybe it should be signed. Extra Documentation needed...
- in BCS instruction, branch operand is assumed to be UNSIGNED int8(always forward branch). Maybe it should be signed. Extra Documentation needed...
- in BEQ instruction, branch operand is assumed to be UNSIGNED int8(always forward branch). Maybe it should be signed. Extra Documentation needed...
- Not quite sure abot BIT instruction...
- in BMI instruction, branch operand is assumed to be UNSIGNED int8(always forward branch). Maybe it should be signed. Extra Documentation needed...
- in BNE instruction, branch operand is assumed to be UNSIGNED int8(always forward branch). Maybe it should be signed. Extra Documentation needed...
- in BPL instruction, branch operand is assumed to be UNSIGNED int8(always forward branch). Maybe it should be signed. Extra Documentation needed...
- STA INSTRUCTIONS could be faster, because it reads a memory position without needing it. Its actually this way because it uses standard Addresses mode functions
ToDo:

- IRQ pin & functions associated
- RW pin isnt functional in code
