ISSUES:
- writeRAM time while writing isnt adjusted...
- in BCC instruction, branch operand is assumed to be UNSIGNED int8(always forward branch). Maybe it should be signed. Extra Documentation needed...

- in BEQ instruction, branch operand is assumed to be UNSIGNED int8(always forward branch). Maybe it should be signed. Extra Documentation needed...
- Not quite sure abot BIT instruction...
- in BMI instruction, branch operand is assumed to be UNSIGNED int8(always forward branch). Maybe it should be signed. Extra Documentation needed...

ToDo:

- IRQ pin & functions
- RW pin isnt functional in code
- Instruction Set
